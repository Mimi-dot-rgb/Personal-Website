                <p>
                    In this project, I've analyzed patient data to uncover patterns, relationships, and risk factors associated with heart disease. It employs various data science techniques, including data cleaning, univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses, to provide insights into predictors of heart disease.

                <p>
                 In this project I've Performed time-series analysis with rolling averages and trend visualizations.
                 Applied hierarchical and KMeans clustering to uncover patterns in the Iris dataset.
                 Built a linear regression model to predict charges based on smoker status, achieving insights into feature correlations.
                 Leveraged libraries like pandas, numpy, sklearn, and matplotlib for efficient data processing and visualization.

                <p>
                    In this project, I explored data across three datasets to generate meaningful insights and actionable outcomes. I worked with pivot tables, cross-tabulations, and clustering to analyze data patterns. I also evaluated soccer players based on their performance metrics using desirability functions, creating a high-performing team from the data.

                <h3>Inclusive Speech, Divided Spaces. Rethinking Public Voice in South Asia                </h3>
                <p>
                    Imagine a world where voices are not merely unheard but are carefully controlled. In this world, the right to speak and the bounds of expression are dictated by unseen forces‚Äîsocial hierarchies that have silently governed public life for centuries. Here, the loudest voices do not emerge naturally from the crowd; they are selected, shaped, and amplified by those with the power to determine what is spoken and who is permitted to speak. Such structures were prominent in colonial systems, where only those who adhered to the colonizer‚Äôs norms of language, dress, and behavior were deemed ‚Äúrespectable.‚Äù Voices that expressed themselves in native dialects or traditional attire were dismissed, their legitimacy denied for failing to conform.

                <h3>Nationalism and the Marginalization of Minorities: A South Asian Perspective</h3>
                <p>
                    Nationalism, at its core, claims to unite a people based on shared beliefs, culture, or language. But beneath this ideal lies a complex issue‚Äîhow does individuality fit into this collective framework? If nationalism is not only a political ideology but also carries with it a historical narrative, whose story is being told, and who gets left out?

                <h3>Structural Barriers to Lasting Social Change, Symbolic Resistance or Real Reform? </h3>
                <p>Public participation is rarely free or democratic in society. 
                   From South Asia to the United States, across geographies, one's right to speak, be heard, and shape discourse is controlled by silent forces of history, culture, and power. Such forces, oozing out of caste, patriarchy, language, corporate control, and State authority, have come to lay a fiat on whose voice would be magnified and whose truths shall remain buried.

                <p>
                    The United States, a first-world country, celebrated for its wealth and innovation, how is it that some of the most vulnerable populations navigating systemic hurdles‚Äîfind themselves caught in the tangled web of healthcare disparities? What is the mistake of these people in this Medicaid political battle that is responsible for them not getting access to the opportunities that they would have in other states?
